          Crowd Changa is a social network that brings together unbanked individuals with limited access to credit to collaborate and contribute towards a social, revolving or and loaning funds accessible by all contributing members. Africa’s biggest problem is not poverty but lack of financial inclussivity. This is in return has had a ripple effect on availability of employment, education, food, water, energy clothing and sanitation. The perennial problems of water, energy and sanitation are interrelated in one way or the other. Sanitation is a by-product of lack of education and water shortage while lack of power energy is as a result of reliability on rain generated energy. Financial support is everything in any emerging economy. In Kenya, women groups use ‘Table Banking’ (locally known as a chama) to raise a loaning fund by pooling resources.

Through these self-help initiatives, they have been able to pay school fees, start businesses, construct water tanks and public toilets, set up solar powered energy automatically solving sanitation and health problems associated with water shortage and use of kerosene and coal respectively. <br> <br>
          <span>The Problem</span> <br> 
          Due to financial literacy and poor management skills 70% of the Chamas break up with problems associated with efficiency, transparency and accountability especially where large groups are involved. This not only affects the relationships but also slows down development and access to basic necessities (Water and energy).
